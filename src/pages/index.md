  title: Por que reutilizar as máscaras FFP2 para uso privado?
  description: As máscaras FFP2 são utilizadas no setor de saúde em áreas com
    risco aumentado de infecção. Projetado como um produto de uso único, as
    máscaras FFP2 devem ser descartadas após o uso para evitar mais riscos de
    infecção. Quando máscaras FFP2 são utilizadas para uso privado (por exemplo,
    compras), pode-se esperar uma carga menor de agentes patogênicos das
    máscaras FFP2. As máscaras FFP2 oferecem melhor proteção do que as máscaras
    médicas faciais (máscaras cirúrgicas) quando usadas corretamente. No
    entanto, sua disponibilidade é limitada. Portanto, a reutilização das
    máscaras FFP2 para uso privado pode ser uma ferramenta útil.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
